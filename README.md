ptrac2root -- A converter from MCNP PTRAC output files to ROOT format
=====================================================================


Description
-----------

This program takes files generated by MCNP in the PTRAC format as input and
produces a ROOT file as output. This ROOT file contains a TTree with all the
events from the PTRAC input file.


Synopsis
--------

ptrac2root input k

- input: The PTRAC input file
- k: The number of input lines in the input file

The output file name is (as of now) fixed to 'out.root'.


PTRAC file format
-----------------

The PTRAC file format information is taken from these sources:

- MCNP Manual Version 4C <http://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-13709-M>
- ParsNIP Homepage <https://sourceforge.net/p/ptracparser/wiki/ParsNIP%20home>


Extensibility
-------------

The ROOT output part is well decoupled from the internal representation of the
data, and adding other output formats should be straight forward.


Bugs
----

The program has been tested on only a limited amount of PTRAC output files,
and therefore may be incomplete.
